# IDS

A Python-based IDS that detects ICMP flood attacks and TCP port scans in real-time using Scapy, with alerts logged and visual ICMP proof captured via Wireshark. It also includes:

📄 Real-time alerts saved in a log file
🖥 A separate alerts_only.py file for live monitoring of alerts
🦈 Wireshark .pcapng file to visualize ICMP traffic
📁 Project Structure Smart_IDS_Project/

├── smart_ids.py # Main IDS with ICMP + Port Scan detection

├── alerts_only.py # Real-time display of alerts from log file

├── alerts_only_log.txt # Log file storing detected attacks

├── icmp loopback capture.pcapng # Wireshark capture of ICMP packets

How It Works

1. Packet Sniffing (Scapy)
Captures live packets using scapy
Analyzes for ICMP floods and TCP port scan behavior
2. ICMP Flood Detection
Tracks the number of pings (ICMP packets) per IP within a short window
Triggers alert if threshold is crossed
3. TCP Port Scan Detection
Tracks how many unique ports an IP hits within 5 seconds
If more than 2, it logs a port scan alert
4. Logging + Real-time Monitoring
Alerts are written to alerts_only_log.txt
You can monitor new alerts live using alerts_only.py
🧪 How to Simulate Attacks
➤ Simulate Port Scan using nmap:
nmap -p 21,22,23,25,80,110,443,8080 127.0.0.1

➤ Simulate ICMP Flood using ping:
ping 127.0.0.1 -t -l 1000 This sends continuous ping requests (ICMP Echo) to your own system, simulating a flood attack. Use Wireshark with the loopback adapter and icmp filter to visually confirm the attack traffic.

Programming Language:
Python 3.6+ - scapy (For packet sniffing and protocol analysis)

Cybersecurity Concepts:
Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

ICMP Flood Detection (Ping Flood)

TCP Port Scan Detection

Threshold-based alert logic

Real-time monitoring & alert logging

Tools for Simulation & Testing:
nmap – To simulate port scanning attacks

ping – To simulate ICMP flood attacks (ping -t -l 1000)

Wireshark – For capturing and visualizing ICMP traffic

Editor & Platform:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Command Prompt (CMD)

Windows OS (with administrator privileges)

Files in the Project:
smart_ids.py – Main IDS detection logic
alerts_only.py – Real-time alert monitor
alerts_only_log.txt – Logs alerts output
icmp loopback capture.pcapng – Wireshark ICMP flood capture
📄 Note:
The file alerts_only_log.txt will be automatically created when you run smart_ids.py. It stores all detected intrusion alerts in real-time.
